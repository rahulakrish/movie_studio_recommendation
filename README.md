# Phase_1 Project

## Description
  To help the head of the newly formed Microsoft Studios get insight into the kind of movies that are currently doing well at the box office. 
  
## Data Source
  I will make use of the `im.db` dataset and the `bm.gross.movie.csv` file for our analysis
  
## Getting Started
  Before I begin, from the outset, I would like to declare that my metric of success is defined by the revenue generated by a movie.
  There are other metrics that can define success,of course, but to me from a business perspective, since the aim of any business is to be profitable,
  the only metric that need consideration is the total gross of each movie.
  
### Question 1
First question that I would like to answer is : What kind of movies do we make? 
This can be also be extrapolated into other questions like : What are audience's taste's like? Are there any genres that are more successful than others? How many different genres are there? etc. 

THe `movie_basics` table, from the `im.db` dataset lists the movie titles with the different genres. I combined it with the `bm.gross.movie.csv` data to get data of the top 10 genres that generated the most revenue. Now, I can pinpoint to a particular genres and say : 'This is the genres that generated the most money and so, these are the kind of movies you should be making'

### Question 2
Second question that needs answering is: Which is the largest market for movies?
Any business
